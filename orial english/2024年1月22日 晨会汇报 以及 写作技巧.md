# Briefing

**Good morning, colleagues.** 
- Today's briefing consists of two parts: a report on last Friday's work and the plan for today.

**Last Friday, my main focus was on restructuring the permit list.** 
- This involved updating breadcrumbs, page titles, list headers, and the text and order within the list, according to the latest design specifications. 
- This was a slight deviation from my original plan, mainly due to backend data interface bottlenecks. 
- However, this deviation hasn't impacted my current development schedule and is entirely manageable for me.

**Today, I will continue working on the development of the 'Game Mate' module.** 
- I'm looking forward to collaborating with the backend team for data interface integration. 
- If higher-priority tasks arise, leading to the continued unavailability of the interface, I'm prepared to shift my focus to refining the details of this feature.

**One point to note is that if the 'Game Mate' related data interface is still not available by tomorrow, it poses a certain risk to my work.** 
- However, considering the lower priority of this module, I can initially use mock data for frontend functionality testing.

**That concludes the updates I needed to share. Thank you all.**
