# Morning Briefing

Good morning, colleagues. Today's briefing is divided into two parts: a summary of yesterday's work and the plan for today.

## Summary of Yesterday's Work
Yesterday, I meticulously [/məˈtɪkjʊləsli/] compared the pages and features related to the gamemate module with the latest design prototype. During this process, I consulted [/kənˈsʌltɪd/] with Mr. Yao to clarify any uncertainties, ensuring my understanding was accurate. Additionally, I addressed some minor flaws [/flɔːz/] related to the module, not initially included in this development phase, to maintain high consistency [/kənˈsɪstənsi/] with the design.

## Plan for Today
Today, if the backend data interface continues to be blocked, I plan to use a server I've set up to provide data services. This self-built server utilizes a tech stack comprising Express, Express middlewares, and a Node package named MySQL.

As for the frontend part of the gamemate module development in this iteration, we are nearing completion. However, to proceed with testing, it's essential to conduct a self-test using the actual backend data interface.

That concludes my report for this morning. I look forward to your feedback. Thank you!
