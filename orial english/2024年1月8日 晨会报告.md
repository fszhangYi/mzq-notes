*Good morning, esteemed colleagues.* 

- Today, I am going to provide an update on my latest work, which is composed of two main aspects.

- On the past Friday, I implemented a new feature in the facility comment section as per Mr. Yao’s instructions from his informative session. 

- Specifically, I engineered the system to enable comments that had been previously marked as 'hidden' to be restored to their 'public' visibility with ease. 

- Subsequently, in the later part of the afternoon, I engaged in a detailed discussion and coordination with Ms. Gui on integrating the data interface for our email backend management module. 

- This feature has been successfully developed and is now poised for the forthcoming round of thorough self-testing.

*For today’s agenda, I am dedicating my efforts to rigorously self-test the functionalities associated with the email backend management module.* 

- Furthermore, as soon as Ms. Zhang finalizes the design for the background image, my task will be to seamlessly integrate this fresh design into our web project’s static resources.

- This encompasses everything I have to share in today’s briefing. 

- I look forward to any feedback you might have and extend my gratitude for your attention. 

*Thank you!*
