Good morning, colleagues.

I would like to update you on my recent work and look forward to your feedback.

Yesterday, I primarily focused on the development of the Game Mate feature.

The first task of this iteration has been completed, and the details are documented on monday.com.

Today, I plan to continue working on the Game Mate feature development, advancing /[ədˈvɑːnsɪŋ]/  the work methodically /[mə'θɒdɪklɪ]/ according to the schedule /[ˈʃedjuːl]/ set on Monday.

I would like to thank the backend colleagues involved in this functionality for their efficient communication, which has greatly facilitated the development process.

That’s all for my update. Thank you, everyone.
