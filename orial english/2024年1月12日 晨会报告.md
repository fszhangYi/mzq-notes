Briefing
Good morning, colleagues.

I'd like to provide an update on my work from yesterday and share my plans for today.

Yesterday, I completed the development of the preview feature for the tutorial and announcement pages.

I also made adjustments to the styling and logic of the existing pages based on the latest design mockups, ensuring that the current state aligns perfectly with the Figma designs.

This feature has been submitted to Mr. Chen for testing, and we are awaiting feedback.



Today, I will collaborate closely with Mr. Chen to address any bugs in the three features scheduled for this iteration, aiming for a bug-free outcome.

Additionally, based on the task breakdown and estimation for the next iteration, I will commence work on the development of the next set of features.



These are my current work arrangements. Thank you, everyone!
