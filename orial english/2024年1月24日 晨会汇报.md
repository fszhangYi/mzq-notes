# Briefing
- Good morning, colleagues. Today, I have two main points to share with you: a summary of my work yesterday and the plan for today.

- Yesterday, we nearly completed the frontend development of the gamemate module, thanks to the backend details provided by our backend colleagues. 
- The next step involves creating some mock data to ensure the entire process functions smoothly. 
- The reason for generating this mock data is that the data provider, specifically the H-five side, is not yet fully developed.

- Today's agenda includes testing the existing interface data functionalities to ensure accuracy before handing them off for testing. 
- The remainder of the day will be dedicated to addressing technical debt by resolving any non-standard parts of the code.

- That's all for the updates I need to synchronize with you today. 
- Thank you all, and I look forward to your feedback.
