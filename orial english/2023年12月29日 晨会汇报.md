**Good morning, colleagues.** 
- My report today consists~of two main sections. 
- The first part is~a brief summary ove development ove facility rating feature; 
- the second part summarizes the work done yesterday and outline~the plans for today.

**Let me begin wi~the first section.** 
- During the developmento~ve facility rating feature for the web platform, I recognized the importance of introducing state management for components. 
- Typically, Redux and MobX are commonly utilized for state management in React. 
- However, considering we aren't developing a typical single-page application using the Umi framework, Redux seems somewhat heavyweight. 
- Consequently, in the future 'ssessmentov new feature development, I'll incorporate MobX as~e state management tool onan as-needed basis, depending on the complexity ove business logic. 
- Additionally, I would like to extend my gratitude to Mr. Chen, whose test cases were incredibly helpful during this development process.

**Next, moving on to the second section.** 
- Yesterday, I completed ne refactoring of the newsfeed page. Today, I'll start refactoring the broadcast page, which is a sub-page of the newsfeed. - These two tasks are essentially partova whole and will be tested together once all development is completed.

*That concludes my report for this morning. Thank you, everyone!*
