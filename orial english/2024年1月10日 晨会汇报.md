## After Modified
Good morning, esteemed colleagues!

Today, I'll provide an update on my recent work, which encompasses two main areas.

Yesterday morning, I participated in a use case session to reaffirm the concerns raised by Mr. Chen and Yao. Following the meeting, I made several modifications and refactorings to the already completed functionalities.

In the latter part of the afternoon, my focus shifted to developing the preview functionality for the "Tutorial" page.

For today, my efforts will be centered on completing this preview functionality. As I am not very familiar with the styles used in the mobile interface, and the preview must match exactly what is shown on mobile devices, I've encountered some challenges in making progress.

This concludes what I have to share in today's briefing. I welcome any feedback and thank you for your attention.

Thank you!
## Before Modified
Good morning, esteemed collegues!

Today, I am going to provide an update on my latest work, which is composed of two main aspects.

Yesterday, I attended the use case in the morning to reconfirms the points that Mr. Chen and Yao concered. Then after the meeting, some modifications or refactorings have been done to the completed functionalities.

Subsequentlly, in the later part of the afternoon, I mainly focus on developing the preview funcationality of the "tutorial" page.

For today's agenda, I'm dedicating my efforts to finishing the preview functionality mentioned above. Since I am not vary familiar with the styles showed in Mobile end and the preview must be exactly same as it shows in Mobile end, the progress doesn't goes smoothly.

This encompasses everything i have to share in today's briefing.
I look forward to any feedback you might have and extend my gratitude for your attention.

Thank you!
