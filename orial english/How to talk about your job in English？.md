## 笔记原文
Hi, Tim here with another 925English lesson! In today's lesson we're going to learn how to talk about your job.

There are lots of situations where you meet someone new and you want to tell them about your job. Maybe they ask you about it, or you just want to introduce yourself/

So how do you do that? Do you just say "I'm a salesman" and that's it? No, you need to say a bit more than that.

You can certainly start by saying what your job is. And you could use the job  name, like "salesperson" or "engineer", or you could say you are in a certain field.

You might also want to mention your position. So rather than just "salesperson", may be you're a regional sales rep.

And besides your job or position, it's a good idea to say where you work. I don't mean the location, I mean the company. So you can name the company, or just what kind of company it is.

Let's practice some examples of talking about your job in this way. Listen to each example, then repeat it yourself. Ready? Let's get started.

A: I'm in sales with a large pharmaceutical company.
B: I'm a senior engineer at Fuller Associates.
C: I work as a sales associate with City Insurance.
D: I'm a marketing manager with BPT.
E: I'm currently the accountant for a small auto parts company.

That was pretty straightforward, wasn't it? As you heard, we use the present simple tense to state simple facts like this. So we just say "I'm... an engineer" or use the short form "I'm an engineer." And notice you can say you work with, at or for a company.

But is that all? I mean, if you just mention your job and company, people won't always understand what you actually do. So you can tell people what your main duties or responsibilities are. I don't mean a long list of duties. I mean what you mainly do.

And to talk about your main duties, we usually start with "I" and a strong verb such as "organize" or "handle" or "lead." And whatever you organize, or handle, or lead will be extra infomation that helps your listener understand your job. That might mean mentioning sepcific people, or places, or activities.

Let's practice talking about your main duties. Once again, repeat the examples after you hear them.

A: I handle tax issues for our larger clients.
B: I take care og all the scheduling.
C: I follow up with customers to make sure they're satisfied with our service. 
D: I supervise our branches in the Southeast Region.
E: I head up the sales team.

All right, so that's how we talk about our main duties. But how does all this sound in real life? Let's listen to a short dialog between two people meeting for the first time. The first person asks about the other person's "line of work," which is like eating what someone's job is.

 A: Nice to meet you John. So what line of work are you in?
 B: I'm in marketing with BT Industries.
 A: Oh, is that right? And what kind of marketing do you do?
 B: I handle all our online and print advertising

Did you hear how that worked? the first person asked about "line of work." The second person started by saying he is "in" marketing and names the company. The other person sounds interested, so the second person uses a strong verb to talk about his main duties.

Now it's your turn to practice. We'll repeat the dialog, but this time we're going to beep out the second person's words. So you will have to say those parts yourself. Remember to start by mentioning the job and company. Then you'll give your main duties. Here we go.

So, that's how we introduce our job to someone. Of course, sometimes we go into a little more detail, either about the work we do, or about the company we work for, And if you tune in to the next couple of lessons, that's exactlly waht you'll learn!

Util then, so long and happy learning!

大家好，我是Tim，欢迎回到925英语课程！在今天的课程中，我们将深入学习如何谈论你的工作。

在社交和专业场合讨论你的工作是一个常见的话题。无论别人询问还是你想自我介绍，有效地表达这一点是关键。

首先，简单地说明你的职位，比如“销售人员”或“工程师”，是一个很好的起点。但是，添加有关你所在领域或行业的具体信息可以提供更清晰的画面。

提及你的具体角色或职位也很有帮助。与其仅说“销售人员”，不如说“区域销售代表”，这提供了更多关于你工作范围的细节。

除了你的职位或角色，提及你的工作地点也增加了背景。除了位置之外，还应包括公司名称或描述公司类型，比如是一家科技初创公司还是跨国公司。

让我们通过更多例子来扩展我们的练习。听一听，然后跟着说：

F: 我在一家科技初创公司负责质量控制。
G: 我是绿色能源解决方案公司的项目协调员。
H: 我在HBC银行作为财务分析师，专注于投资策略。
I: 我负责一家知名律师事务所的客户关系。
J: 我在一家快速成长的软件公司领导开发团队。

记住，我们用现在简单时态来陈述这样的事实。像“我在……工作”或“我负责……”这样的短语很常见。

但还不止于此。除了说明你的职位和公司，讨论你的主要职责也很有帮助。这并不意味着列出每一项职责，而是强调你角色的关键方面。

在讨论职责时，使用强动词，如“管理”、“协调”或“开发”。包括具体内容，比如你管理、协调或开发的人或事物。

让我们尝试更多关于职责的例子：

F: 我协调国际合作和项目。
G: 我为客户需求开发新的软件解决方案。
H: 我管理新员工的招聘和培训。
I: 我负责年度预算和财务规划。
J: 我进行市场趋势的研究和分析。

在真实对话中，这些细节可以激发进一步的讨论。考虑这样一个对话：

A: 很高兴认识你，玛利亚。你在TechGenius担任什么角色？
B: 我领导用户体验团队。
A: 真有趣！这涉及哪些工作？
B: 我负责设计和改进我们的软件界面。

注意对话是如何自然地从工作转移到具体职责的。

现在，尝试这个互动练习。我们将播放一段对话，你需要填写你的工作和职责。

总之，准确描述你的工作不仅仅是谈论你的职位。它是关于传达你的角色性质、你的职责以及你的工作环境背景。这种方式提供了

全面的画面，并促进了有趣的对话。

请继续关注我们接下来的课程，我们将深入探讨如何描述你的工作和公司。

那么，我们下次课再见，祝学习愉快！
