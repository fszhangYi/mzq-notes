- Colleagues, good morning everyone. 
- Today, I have two aspects of information to **synchronize with** you all, which are my summary of yesterday's work and my plans for today.

---
- Yesterday, I had a **productive discussion** with Mr. Yao **regarding** the **prototype on Figma**, and we worked to understand and **align on the points of disagreement**. 
- **Based on this**, I completed the task of restructuring the "Add New Schedule" modal, and later worked together with our backend colleagues to implement the information filling and submission functionality for Schedule editing.

---
- Today, my plan is to complete the "Gamemate List" and "Game Detail" pages. 
- Additionally, I will continue to maintain **close and efficient communication** with our **backend colleagues** to ensure **the smooth progress of** the Gamemate module's development.

---
- That's the information I needed to synchronize with you all. 
- I look forward to receiving your feedback. Thank you, everyone!
