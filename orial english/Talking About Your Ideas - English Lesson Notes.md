# Raw Material
Hi! Tim here with another 925English lesson! In today's lesson we're going to learn how to talk about your ideas.

You might be full of ideas about your company, your products, or how to connect with your customers. But those ideas aren't very useful if you can't tell other people about them.

You probably find yourself in lots of situdations where you might talk about your ideas. Think about a staff meeting or a business lunch. Everyone's talking about what the company should do, and you've got a good idea. So do you just shout it out for everyone to hear?

No, rather than just shouting out your idea, it's best to introduce it first. I mean, you should tell everyone that you had an idea you want to share. And you might say exactly that, like "I've got something to share." Or you could say "here's what I've been thinking" or "how about this ..." These are just some of the ways that you can introduce your idea.

How about practicing some of these expressions? We're going to present some examples. After you hear each example, try repeating it yourself. Ready? Let's give it a go.

A: How about this for an idea
B: Here's what i've been thinking about
C: i've got something i'd like to share on this point
D: one way of looking at this would be to

So, we've just practiced some different ways of introducing an idea. Once you've done that, then people are prepared. They are now listening to hear what you have to say.

But you need to be a bit careful how you state your idea. If you're not the boss, you'll need to avoid saying "we have to" or "it's neccessary for us" to do something. In many situations, that's too strong. If you're just making a suggestion, then you need something softer.

One way of suggesting an idea is saying "we could." That's a polite way to present your idea as one possibility. So in a marketing meeting, you might say "we could create some new TV ads?"

Another really simple way to present your idea is with the words "I think." For example, you might say "I think we should lower our costs". That's just a bit softer than saying "we should lower our costs," which is too direct. Many people don't like to hear ideas suggested that directly.

Now, it's your turn to try using these expressions. You'll hear some examples. After each example, repeat what you hear. Let's begin.

A: We could hold a big promotional event.
B: I think there are a few ways we could cut costs.
C: What if we bought the building instead of renting it?
D: why don't we make a mobile version of the website?

As you heard, to suggest an idea sometimes we ask a question. That shows that we are open to what other people think. After all, you're not giving orders. Rather, you're trying to get people to think your idea is a good one.

So, it's important simply to ask them what they think about it. You might ask an entire group of people, by saying "how does everyone feel about that?" or "anyone have any thoughts on this?" you might also askone person to respond, with something like "what's your view on this Betty?"

One more simple way to ask waht people think about an idea is with the question "How does that sound?" And do you notice - in this and the other expressions i've given you - that we say this or that to refer to the idea? Using these words is better than saying my idea, or asking "do you agree with me?"

Why is saying "this" better than saying "my idea?" Well, because you want people to focus on the idea, not on whose idea it is. If you say "me" or "my" a lot, people might feel you are thinking about yourself too much.

Let's practice using these expressions for asking what people think about your ideas. Remember to repeat each example you after you hear it.

A: How does everyone feel about that?
B: What's your view on this, Dave?
C: How does that sound?
D: Anyone have any thoughts on this?

Ok, you've done some great practice with some useful expressions, but how does this sound in a conversation? Well, let's listen to a short discussion between Sandra and Kelly about a new office design.

A: look at the office layout, does anyone have any ideas?
B: Yes, i've got something i'd like to share on this
A: Sure, go ahead
B: Well, what if we put another meeting room on the 2nd floor?

Can you see how that worked?
Sandra says she's "got something to share" about the office layout. Then, once everyone's listening, she makes a suggestion using a "what if" question.

Now, it's your turn to practice. We'll repeat the dialog, but this time we'll beep out Sandra's words. You'll have to say those parts yourself. Remember, first you'll say that you have something to share. And then you'll suggest putting another meeting room on the 2nd floor.

Alright, so we've learned	 somegreat ways to talk about your ideas,and ask what other people think about your ideas. In our next lesson, we'll learn about how to agree with other people's idea. Util then, so long and happy learning!
